# Rush Hour

Welcome to Rush Hour!

This was one of my favourite games as a kid, and so I recreated it in javascript a few years ago.

I have now put in online for anyone who wants to play!

Make sure to also support the original creators and consider buying a physical copy from them [here](https://www.thinkfun.com/products/rush-hour/).

## Features
* **All the levels: Includes all the entire 40 original levels from the physical game**
* **Simple: Comes in a very simple UI that anyone can use**
* **Open for changes: Since this is open source, you can add your own levels!**

## Getting Started
To play the game just [click here](https://orijer.github.io/RushHour/).

You should start by going over the tutorial.
Then you can choose the level you want to play. 

I suggest starting from the first level and completing them one by one.

## Controls
At any time you may press ESCAPE to go back to the main menu.

During the game, you can press R to restart the level you are at.

When finishing a level, press SPACE to go to the next level.

## Creating your own levels
In order to create your own level you first need to download the files from this repository.
In the level-preparer.js, you can add your own custom level, and play it as you wish.

## Built With
the game itself was built using p5.js which is a JavaScript library that helps creating interactive visuals in web pages.

More on p5.js can be found [here](https://p5js.org/).
